"""Generate and cache a rich Brian profile summary using GPT-4o.

Reads all curated facts from profile.jsonl, shared_learned.jsonl, and
user memory, synthesizes them into a cohesive narrative profile via GPT-4o,
and saves to data/brian_profile_summary.txt.

The saved summary is injected as a STATIC prefix in every system prompt,
enabling OpenAI prompt caching on the consistent portion of the context.
